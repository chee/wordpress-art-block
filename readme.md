# art block

gutenberg block that provides you with a javascript highlighted text editor, and posts the content of it an iframe with p5 injected.

the width of the block will be the width of its container.
set the `height` property in the sidebar to set the height.
use `createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)` when creating your canvas :)

heavily inspired by [mark uraine's p5 block](https://markuraine.com/creating-the-p5-js-gutenberg-block/).

when i say "inspired" i mean that every time i couldn't figure out what to do next, i read mark's codebase
