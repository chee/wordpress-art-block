# art block

gutenberg block that provides you with a javascript highlighted text editor, and posts the content of it an iframe with p5 injected.

heavily inspired by [mark uraine's p5 block](https://markuraine.com/creating-the-p5-js-gutenberg-block/).

when i say "inspired" i mean that every time i couldn't figure out how to make it work i literally just read mark's codebase.
